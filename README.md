# *Lexi Trees*: Probabilistic and Deterministic Self-Balancing Binary Search Trees

Since GitHub can't render the DOC.md file correctly, please see the [HTML version](https://mtomassoli.github.io/lexi-trees/DOC.html).

I noticed that Firefox doesn't render the GIF animations too well because it's not very good at scaling down high res pictures that contain thin lines. Chrome does a much better job.

Please let me know if there are any issues!
